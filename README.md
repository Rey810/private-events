# private-events

## A Project in Partial Completion of The Odin Project

The aim here was to build a site similar to [Eventbrite](www.eventbrite.com) which allows users to create events and then manage user signups.

## Site Function Goals:
    1. A user can create events
    2. A user can attend many events
    3. An event can be attended by many users

 *Site design was not regarded as important for this exercise in functionality*
