## A [Project](www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/associations) in Partial Completion of The Odin Project

## Skills Used/Gained
1. Database Schema and data architecture
2. Rails ActiveRecord Associations

## Site Function Goals:
    1. A user can create events
    2. A user can attend many events
    3. An event can be attended by many users
